# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
In this analysis we will be analyzing the credit card dataset from LendingClub and using machine learning and statistical reasoning to predict if a person is low risk or high risk for having a creit card. We will use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

## Purpose of Analysis

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Results

Below are the Results from six machine learning models that that we ran along with the balanced accuracy scores, the precision and recall scores.
